  <p>The Philippines was devastated by a super typhoon in November 2013 that affected 16 million people. 
  UCLA student donations played a part in the relief missions of several aid agencies in the wake of the storm.</p>
  
  <p>The typhoon has two names, Haiyan and Yolanda. These stories use Yolanda, its Filipino name, for consistency and 
  cultural accuracy.</p>
  
  <p>Reporter Katie Shepherd, photojournalist Neil Bedi and data journalist Byron Lutz spent 19 days in the Philippines 
  talking to survivors of the typhoon, displaced residents and aid organizations about the massive rehabilitation 
  efforts underway in the Eastern Visayas.</p>
  
  <p>The Bridget Oâ€™Brien Scholarship Foundation has funded seven years of UCLA student journalism with global reach 
  and local impact, including this project. To learn more about the scholarship, visit rememberingbridget.com.</p>
