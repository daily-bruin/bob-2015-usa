    "name": "Plyler v. Doe",
    "description": "Plyler v. Doe was a landmark Supreme Court case between several unnamed undocumented children and a Texas school district. In 1975, Texas passed Education Code section 21.031, which denied local school districts any state funding for undocumented children, and a group of children in the Tyler school district sued the superintendent, James Plyler. The Court ruled in favor of the children in the case, shaping the way the U.S. would come to treat the youngest undocumented people seeking a public education in the country."

    "name": "Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA)",
    "description": "Four years after Plyler, Congress passed a comprehensive legalization bill which offered permanent residence to undocumented people who had been in the country since January 1, 1982 and met certain other requirements. It also included a legalization program with less stringent requirements for agricultural workers. About 2.7 million undocumented immigrants became permanent residents through IRCA."

    "name": "287(g)",
    "description": "This federal program follows two basic models: the “jail model,” which greatly resembles CAP, calling for local authorities to assist federal officials in removing deportable individuals; and the “task force model,” which makes immigration status checks a part of local police work. Jessica Colotl, one of the undocumented young people we interviewed for this story, was held in detention in Georgia through the 287(g) program."

    "name": "Secure Communities",
    "description": "Secure Communities calls for the fingerprints of anyone arrested in booked by state or local law enforcement, to be checked against federal databases. If an immigration violation shows up, DHS can issue a “detainer,” or a request that the state or local jail hold the individual for a period not to exceed 48 hours over the time they would originally have been released."

    "name": "Priority Enforcement Program",
    "description": "PEP is the newest federal program made for state/local adoption. In general, it replaces Secure Communities’ use of detainers with “requests for notification,” or requests that ICE be notified of a pending release. However, under PEP, ICE may still issue detainers under “special circumstances.” Note: Not all state/local authorities have historically honored ICE detainers. San Francisco and Los Angeles generally do not, for example."

    "description": "This expansion, announced in November 2014, increases the length of the deferred action period for DACA recipients from two to three years. It also grants deferred action to certain undocumented parents of American citizens and permanent residents. Several states have sued the federal government over this action, and a Texas court has issued an order that currently blocks the expanded DACA and DAPA programs from being implemented."

    "name": "Prop 187",
    "description": "Though most of its provisions never took effect, this law would have barred undocumented immigrants from accessing public benefits; it would have kept children out of public school, and required state and local government employees to verify the status of people they encountered in their jobs. Many of these provisions were ruled to be unconstitutional in a 1995 court case."
