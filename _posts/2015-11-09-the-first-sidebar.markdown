description: Jessica Colotl found herself at the forefront of undocumented student activism in Georgia, after being arrested for a minor traffic violation in 2010.

---

Jessica Colotl had spent almost a month in a concrete-lined Alabama detention center, but completing her bachelor’s degree in political science and walking across a stage with her diploma was all she could think about.
 
When she was arrested in March 2010, Colotl was about a semester and a half from graduation. After being held in the detention center for two weeks, she asked Kennesaw State University’s registrar’s office to withdraw her from her classes.
 
“At first I was hopeful,” she said. “I was willing to go to Mexico as long as I had my diploma. But (withdrawing from classes) felt like giving up.”
 
Five years ago, Colotl found herself at the center of the undocumented student movement in Georgia. She now works as a paralegal for Kuck Immigration Partners, the law firm that helped her finish her college degree.
 
On Mar. 29, 2010, university police arrested Colotl for impeding the flow of traffic and asked about her legal status, in accordance with the <a href="https://www.ice.gov/factsheets/287g">Delegation of Immigration Authority Section 287(g), Immigration and Nationality Act</a>. Under the Immigrations and Custom Enforcement program, local authorities acted as immigration officials when inmates were booked into detention centers. 

Colotl never imagined she could be deported, even as an officer demanded to see a driver’s license she knew she didn’t have. But when officers discovered Colotl was undocumented, she was immediately put into removal proceedings. 
 
While Colotl was detained, her family repeatedly tried to post bond. Every time, officers told them there wasn’t a reason to pay for Colotl’s release because she would eventually be deported. Instead of visiting their daughter, Colotl’s parents spoke with her over the phone, fearing they would be detained as well.
 
“Being away was painful for everyone,” she said. “It was a difficult situation, but my family was always supportive.”
 
At Colotl’s bond hearing, almost a month after she arrived at the detention center, an immigration judge determined Colotl was eligible for voluntary departure – she would have to leave the country, but at her own expense.
 
“I was devastated, and I immediately broke down,” she said. “I knew I had to say goodbye to school, my family and my friends.”
 
Colotl then returned to the detention center, where she waited for her mother to mail her a plane ticket to Mexico. She said she felt she had been lied to – her high school teachers and college professors told her doing well in school was the key to success.
 
“I was in college, doing everything I could to get an education,” she said. “But when something like this happens to you, you lose hope.”
 
Colotl added she felt the U.S. betrayed her. After taking several constitutional law classes and learning the U.S. had one of the best judicial systems in the world, she couldn’t wrap her mind around how this could happen to her.
 
“Being deported for a minor traffic offense is so cruel,” Colotl said. “Driving without a license wasn’t the worst thing in the world, and I felt I had already done my time.”
 
Colotl’s case became public a few days after her Lambda Theta Alpha sorority sisters protested during the May 1 march to the Georgia Capitol.
 
“It was one of the few times college students partook in justice,” she said. “My sisters were trying to raise awareness, because they thought it was over – but everything changed.”
 
Immigration organizations, such as the Georgia Association for Latino Elected Officials, then became active in Colotl’s case. On May 5, Colotl was released from the detention facility and granted a one-year deferred action so she could finish school. Kuck Immigration Partners helped her renew the deferral in 2011, before Colotl became eligible for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals in 2012.
 
“It was a miracle,” she said. “It’s hard to believe something like this could happen after you lose everything.”
 
Colotl said she plans to go to law school and use her insight from being on the other side of the legal process to help other undocumented individuals in Georgia.
 
“I’m proud of my Latino roots, but Georgia is home,” she said.
