California’s comparatively welcoming policies for undocumented students have not dampened the activism happening among students here. 

If anything, activism and organizing for undocumented students at the University of California has expanded in scope since the California Dream Act was passed and President Barack Obama announced Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. 

There has been a shift in the way undocumented students view their activism, said Vlad Stoicescu-Ghica, a fifth-year political science student and co-chair of Improving Dreams, Equality, Access and Success – or IDEAS – a support and advocacy organization at UCLA for undocumented students. 

“A lot of the work before us was focused on school, on education policy,” he said. “Now our focus has become a lot more about what we can do for our families.”

In the last few years, IDEAS activists have begun to look beyond their identities as students, and see themselves more largely as part of an undocumented community, Stoicescu-Ghica said. They partnered with ICE Out of L.A., a community organization working to halt deportations in the city and fight against local and state police cooperation with federal immigration agencies. Some members of IDEAS have even been arrested during protests against deportation. 

Students have also begun pushing back against the use of the term “DREAMer,” arguing that it serves only to divide the immigrant community and cast one group as “deserving” of protection while criminalizing others. 

That idea has begun to take hold for a greater number of students at the UC – it was a central theme at the UC summit in May on undocumented students, where students from every campus gathered to discuss how the University could improve its access and success within the system.

And it has impacted the way IDEAS advocates for resources on campus, as well.  

One of the organization’s largest pushes this year is to pressure UCLA to establish an immigration law clinic like the one that serves UC Berkeley. The Berkeley Immigration Law Clinic provides legal services to students and their families who might also need them, Stoicescu-Ghica said. It’s the family and community components that are particularly important to IDEAS members, since currently their families cannot receive comprehensive legal consultation or services at UCLA.

Still, on-campus resources have remained a large part of IDEAS’ advocacy work. Since Janet Napolitano was appointed president of the University in 2013, undocumented students throughout the UC have consistently applied pressure on her to show her commitment to supporting them. Napolitano had a lot to prove, coming fresh out of a job in which she oversaw record numbers of deportations. Some undocumented students will likely never feel comfortable with her at the head of the system.

At least on the surface, their protests did not go unnoticed. Shortly after her appointment, a council of undocumented student leaders assembled to meet with Napolitano and advise her on their needs and concerns with her position as president. 

As a result of those talks, Napolitano allotted $5 million to go toward undocumented student resources across the UC. Each campus received an amount based in part on the number of undocumented students enrolled. About half of the money to each campus was specifically allotted for financial aid, and the other half for programming. It was a one-time allocation meant to last for two years of funding. This is the second year that campuses will have this money, although Napolitano could choose to commit to further funding at the end of this fiscal year.

Undocumented students wait with baited breath for that decision, hoping that it will pave the way for greater resources at the UC – ones that help not only them, but also their families and the whole community.
