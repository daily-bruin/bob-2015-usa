“I used to ask myself, ‘Why should I get involved? Why should I be the one to say anything?’” 

Reuben John Ronquillo, who goes by RJ, sat in a swivel chair in the UCLA graduate student resource center where he works. We sat at a long, communal table that takes up most of the room. He looked pensive and a little careful. 

“But then I realized: It’s the folks that share their stories that get to help shape the narrative. And if it weren’t for the work they did before me, I would not be here today.”

Ronquillo is a fifth-year Asian American studies student and co-chair of Improving Dreams, Equality, Access and Success at UCLA. He and his family immigrated to the United States in 2004 from the Philippines, chasing after a vision of life and family that they felt the U.S. could offer them: They wanted, once and for all, to be under the same roof as one another. 

Back in the Philippines, Ronquillo’s father and mother both worked overseas at different times. They were college-educated, but even so, the only tenable employment they could find to support the family was outside the borders of their home country. Ronquillo’s father was a seaman for many years, and eventually both he and Ronquillo’s mother moved to Japan for work. 

“I can count on two hands how many times we were able to celebrate any Christmas or birthday all together,” Ronquillo said. 

So they chose to move everyone all at once, out of the Philippines and to the U.S., where his parents could work to support their family in the same place they were raising their sons.

It did not work out quite the way they had hoped. 

His parents needed to turn their H-1B visas, given to them for work, into green cards, which would allow them to stay in the United States indefinitely as permanent residents. They hired lawyers, paying $10,000 to $12,000 in legal fees and expenses throughout their application process, Ronquillo said. 

Even so, his father’s lawyer didn’t file a crucial piece of paperwork, and he not only didn’t get his green card – he lost his H-1B visa. 

In 2008, when the recession hit, Ronquillo’s mother was laid off from her job and lost her H-1B visa, too. Every member of her family depended on that visa as their legal authority to remain in the United States. Without it, they all fell out of status.

Ronquillo was just finishing high school when he became undocumented. 

“I didn’t know what to do. The undocumented student movement was still in its nascent stages ... I knew I couldn’t go to college. We didn’t have the money. We were barely making ends meet,” he said. 

As the years passed and the movement gained traction, college didn’t seem quite so impossible a dream. His father enrolled him in community college in San Fernando Valley, where he racked up credits and requirements for three years. California passed its state Dream Act in 2011, which would give him access to state financial aid when it took effect. His little brother Seth began attending UCLA, becoming involved in advocacy efforts for undocumented students here. 

Now Ronquillo finds himself on the brink of graduation, wondering how much of this was worth it. In 2011, his father made the difficult decision to go back to the Philippines to take a job that was waiting for him there. Years in the United States had not made it easier for him to find work that supported his family. He was hurt deeply by his inability to provide for his children in the United States the way he was supposed to, Ronquillo said. 

“There was so much frustration in our house, it was ready to be lit like a match,” he added. “We came here so all five of us could be together. And now that’s not even true.”

Last year, Seth graduated from UCLA and his father could not attend the ceremony. Because of the time he spent in the country without legal authorization, he is not eligible to apply for a visa until 2021.

The sacrifices that his father made and the deep unfairness with which he feels his family has been treated, struggling through being undocumented despite trying so hard to move through the legal process in the beginning, have spurred Ronquillo into advocacy work he never thought he would take part in. 

“(When you’re undocumented), it feels like ... they knock you down, and when you fall, they keep kicking you,” he said. “I don’t want to be one of the ones who do nothing about that. I want to help students keep their families together.”
