description: After volunteering as a consultant on deportation cases, UCLA law professor Hiroshi Motomura decided to focus his teachings on immigration policy.

---

Three-year-old Hiroshi Motomura, bundled tight in a peacoat and adorned with a bowtie, stood on the windy docks in Japan and watched his mother say goodbye to her parents.
 
When he and his mother arrived in San Francisco in 1957, Motomura was technically stateless – neither an American nor Japanese citizen. He eventually became a naturalized U.S. citizen when he was 15 years old.
 
Motomura’s father was born in the U.S., and returned years later as a young adult. His mother was allowed to immigrate to be with her husband, and Motomura’s younger brother was born in California three years later.
 
In his first book, titled “Americans in Waiting: The Lost Story of Immigration and Citizenship in the United States,” Motomura describes the ingroup-outgroup dynamic immigrants in the U.S. face – a separation between “us” and “them.”
 
“My family history shows the law makes distinctions, most prominently between citizens and noncitizens,” Motomura wrote. “Over the course of American history, families like ours have started out as ‘them’ and ended up as ‘us.’”
 
Motomura is now a UCLA law professor who teaches classes on immigrant rights and immigration law and reform. He began teaching at UCLA in 2007, and in 2014 received the UCLA Distinguished Teaching Award, intended to honor professors who have greatly impacted students.
 
After graduating from the UC Berkeley School of Law in 1978, Motomura began his career in immigration law as a volunteer consultant on deportation cases, helping to keep families together.
 
“When you work on something like that, it stays with you,” he said.

In 2014, Motomura published his most recent book, titled “Immigration Outside the Law.” He discusses what it means to be an undocumented individual and offers solutions for controversial immigration policy issues.

Motomura said he thinks the U.S. has an economic system designed to tolerate undocumented individuals, using them to repair infrastructure and maintain food systems for cheap. He compared undocumented individuals in the U.S. to workers hired for house repairs.
 
“It’s ridiculous to invite someone in, and then be shocked and outraged about their presence,” Motomura said.
 
Motomura added he is concerned state and local officials are given too much power in immigration enforcement, because he thinks immigration law is highly subjective and case by case in nature. Federal law grants state and local officials in most states the power to arrest undocumented individuals as they see fit, which he said can lead to racial and ethnic profiling.
 
“The discretion to arrest is what matters,” Motomura said. “The chances are low that you’ll be arrested, but once you’re put in the system, the chances are high you’ll be deported.”

Motomura said he thinks the federal government should work harder to prevent discrimination on state and local levels, because some immigrants are treated unequally under the current system. The federal government should implement a mechanism for the law to detect improper behavior from officers, and limit the number of officers who can enforce immigration law, Motomura said.
 
He added he doesn’t think it’s fair to ban undocumented students from attending universities to open up spots for citizen students because a fair legal system would recognize the contributions and sacrifices undocumented individuals have made.
 
“We should have a policy that makes for a stronger country,” Motomura said. “Some of the undocumented students I’ve met are unbelievably motivated people who are looking for a foundation.”
 
Motomura said he thinks implementing enforceable policies is critical to solving immigration issues, but undocumented individuals who have previously been invited to work in the country should be accommodated.
 
He added he favors granting legal status to undocumented individuals within the U.S., but to avoid having similar immigration problems in the future, the federal government still needs to change how officials let people into the country.
 
“The situation we’re in is not one that arose overnight, it arose over generations,” Motomura said. “Look back at 1986, when we legalized a significant number of people in the country. Here we are 30 years later, asking the same questions.”
