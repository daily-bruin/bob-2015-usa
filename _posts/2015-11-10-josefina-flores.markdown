Just before the start of her first quarter at UCLA, Josefina Flores had to come up with $4,000. She was short nearly the entire amount of her fall quarter tuition, and she needed to secure her spot in classes.  

This is a familiar story to many – plenty of students struggle to pay for college, especially as tuition has continued to rise dramatically at the University of California over the past decade. But as an undocumented student, Flores’ situation was a little different than the run-of-the-mill student loan debt struggle that has become a familiar refrain throughout the country.

It was fall 2012, a full quarter before the California Dream Act was set to take effect. That legislation would give Flores access to state financial aid for her education, including the Cal Grant.

She did not qualify for any federal aid and needed that imminent state funding to be able to go to school.

“This was $4,000 that I did not have,” she said. “There was no such thing as a college savings for me. I tried to convince myself that maybe starting off at a community college would be better, but a bigger part of me knew I needed to come (to UCLA).” 

So as her senior year of high school wound down to a close, Flores frantically applied to every scholarship she could find, trying to scrape together the money to pay for the quarter that was not funded. At the end of the year, when she counted everything together, she had won $4,000 – almost exactly the amount of her fall quarter tuition. 

“It was almost like it was meant to be,” she said.

Flores was three years old when she immigrated to the United States with her father, mother and older sister. They lived in a garage behind her aunt’s house for their first few years in the country, eventually saving enough to move into their own apartment. Shortly after they arrived, Flores’ mother had her third daughter, and her father left the family.

“Watching my mom with three girls by herself was one of the hardest things,” Flores said. “She found a way when there was no way and found an answer when there was no answer. She is the person I want to be in the future.”

Her mother’s struggle made the financial burden of college seem that much more impossible to bear, Flores said. Her journey to college was fraught with uncertainty and worry about what she could qualify for and how she could pay. 

When she was in the tenth grade, she took a college tour of UC Berkeley with her class. While she was there, her tour group coincidentally met an undocumented student on campus who briefly talked to them about her status. That student’s very presence on campus gave Flores hope that she could make it work somehow, that she could go to college. 

“That (experience) was something I kept with me throughout the rest of high school,” she said. 

And so far, Flores has made it work. She is a fourth-year psychology student with a public health minor, on track to graduate this year. She has taken active roles in Improving Dreams, Equality, Access and Success – UCLA’s undocumented student support and advocacy group – throughout her time at UCLA. She has also been involved with community organizations like the Hermandad Mexicana Nacional, a nonprofit organization in the San Fernando Valley that provided legal services to the undocumented community in that area. 

In high school, Flores’ mother constantly had to reassure her that everything would turn out for the best and that she shouldn’t worry. Flores was scared and uncertain about what her future would look like. 

“Now, we’ve switched,” she said. “I’m reassuring her that I’m okay now, not the other way around.”
