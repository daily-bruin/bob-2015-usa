Jessica Colotl had spent almost a month in a concrete-lined Alabama detention center, but completing her bachelor’s degree in political science and walking across a stage with her diploma was all she could think about.
 
When she was arrested in March 2010, Colotl was about a semester and a half from graduation. After being held in the detention center for two weeks, she asked Kennesaw State University’s registrar’s office to withdraw her from her classes.
 
“At first I was hopeful,” she said. “I was willing to go to Mexico as long as I had my diploma. But (withdrawing from classes) felt like giving up.”
