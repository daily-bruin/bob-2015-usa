Etched into his forearm in large, blocky script are the coordinates of Paolo Jara-Riveros’ home in Lima, Peru.

It’s a tattoo in remembrance of his first home, the place he still carries in his heart even now that he lives half a world away. Jara-Riveros lived in that spacious yellow house with his mother and grandparents in Lima until he was 15 years old, when his mother lost her job as an accountant in Miraflores, an affluent part of the city. 

When that happened, Paolo said, she decided to try her luck in the United States, and she brought Paolo with her. They traveled there on a tourist visa and did not go back home when it expired.

The transition was not an easy one for Jara-Riveros, who arrived in the U.S. smack in the middle of high school, knowing just a little bit of English from his private school education in Peru. 

But even more difficult to adjust to than his new surroundings was his immigration status – a sudden source of deep shame, thrust upon him from what felt like all directions. 

“The first knowledge I had about immigration was in reference to me being ‘an illegal,’” he said. “When people talked about undocumented people like they were criminals, I really took that to heart. It made me believe I was worth less than other people.”

That feeling followed him through his last two years of high school in Alhambra, his five years at a community college in Pasadena and finally his two semesters at Cal Poly Pomona studying hospitality management. After that, Jara-Riveros had had enough.

“I just didn’t want to be undocumented anymore,” he said. 

To top it off, his studies in hospitality management at Cal Poly Pomona were unexciting at best, torturous at worst. He wanted to study photography, and he wanted to do it somewhere he could live without the pressure and shame that accompanied his status. 

So he set his sights on an arts school in Spain. In order to attend, he would have to go back to Lima and apply for a student visa, meaning that he would likely not be able to gain re-entry to the United States, where his mother lived. And if the visa was denied, he would be stuck in Lima, unable to go to school in Spain or to come back to see his mother in the U.S.

But it was worth the risk for Jara-Riveros, who saw little point in remaining in a country that criminalized his very presence. 

Unfortunately, the risk was real and present. About a month after arriving in Lima, Jara-Riveros got word that his visa had been denied.
 
“I shut myself up in my room and cried the whole day,” Jara-Riveros said in Spanish. “There I was, in Lima, stuck.”

And being stuck in Lima was no small thing for Jara-Riveros, whose situation was complicated by his sexual orientation.

As of today, Jara-Riveros identifies as a gender nonconforming man. He considers himself straight, because he identifies as a man and is attracted to women.

When he was living in Peru, Jara-Riveros was still identifying as a lesbian woman. In a country where the law often does not protect victims of hate crimes and discrimination, his identity created a dangerous situation for him and put his safety at risk. 

“In Peru, especially in Lima, queer people, transgender women, women, all get killed there. Police watch and don’t do anything,” Jara-Riveros said. 

So when the National Immigrant Youth Alliance, an advocacy organization for undocumented youth, began organizing an initiative to bring back young undocumented students who had been deported or left the country, Jara-Riveros jumped at the chance to join. 

“When I started organizing (with NIYA), I had never even heard the words ‘civil disobedience’ before,” he said. 

But soon, Jara-Riveros would live out the meaning of those words. Along with a group of 30 other undocumented students and armed with immigration lawyers, Jara-Riveros marched to the U.S.-Mexico border dressed in his cap and gown, demanding to be let through. 

He and several other students were arrested and detained, but many eventually were, in fact, let through after being held in detention. 

Jara-Riveros is currently in the U.S. under consideration for asylum. Being sent back to Peru would put him in real danger, he said, especially now that he has transitioned to living as a man. In six to 10 years, a court will decide on Jara-Riveros’ case, and could eventually send him back to Lima. 

But right now, Jara-Riveros is focused on the moment. His first act of civil disobedience was not his last; in fact, it spurred a drive in him to continue doing activist work for his community. 

He is now a member of the Immigrant Youth Coalition in Los Angeles, and recently wrapped up an internship at St. John’s Well Child and Family Center, which offers health services to undocumented transgender individuals. 

He no longer feels the kind of shame and stigma he used to feel about his status, he said, and he credits his activist work for that. 

“I’ve learned a lot doing this work. The first thing is not to be afraid,” he said. “That’s why we chant that phrase together: undocumented and unafraid.”
